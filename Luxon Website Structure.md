The key is keeping it **simple, clear, and conversion-focused**. Every page should answer "What do you do?", "Why should I trust you?", and "How do I get started?" within seconds. You can always add blog, video, detailed technical specs later—but this 5-page foundation will convert leads from your Google Business Profile, Nextdoor, and referral partners immediately.
